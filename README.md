**VIE ET MANA**

I made this little program to test if could use some of my newly acquired coding and signal processing skills.
(And also because I am very bad at managing my mana and health in PoE.)

**I didn't compile it in a downloadable package yet, so it's just a place to store the code before I compile a decent version of the programs.**

- The programs work by taking small and fast screenshot at an optimized pace so it works well but don't create a perfomance issue on storage devices.
- The user can start the program and stop it when he wants with the big switch button.
- Then it checks if certain pixels in the game windows are in a specific rgb code so see if the health or mana bars are filled on certain level.
- If the color doesn't match it press the mana/health potion keybind.
- The user can set the active time of the current potions he has, so the programs won't reuse a potion while a previous one is still active.


Here is how the interface looks :
